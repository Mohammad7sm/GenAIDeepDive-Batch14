      "Here are four key achievements of Mahatma Gandhi:\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Non-Violent Indian Independence Movement**: Gandhi led the Indian independence movement against British rule using non-violent civil disobedience techniques such as boycotts, fasting, and peaceful protests. This approach ultimately contributed to India's independence on August 15, 1947.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Salt March (1930)**: In response to a tax imposed by the British government, Gandhi led a 24-day march from Ahmedabad to Dandi in Gujarat, where he defied the salt tax by producing and selling salt from the sea. This iconic event drew international attention and became a symbol of resistance against colonial rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Civil Disobedience Movement (1920-1922)**: Gandhi launched this movement against British taxation policies, which included laws requiring Indians to register their property and pay taxes in pounds sterling. The movement led to widespread protests, marches, and acts of civil disobedience, ultimately resulting in the release of many prisoners.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Nehru's 'Four Freedoms' (1946)**: Gandhi supported Mahatma Nehru's vision for India, which included four \"fundamental rights\" or freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, freedom from want, freedom to work, and freedom from fear. These principles were outlined in Nehru's presidential address to the Constituent Assembly, setting the foundation for India's post-independence constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: There are many other achievements and contributions that Mahatma Gandhi made throughout his life, but these four points highlight some of the most significant and widely recognized ones.\n"
